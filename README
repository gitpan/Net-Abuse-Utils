NAME
    Net::Abuse::Utils - Routines useful for processing network abuse

VERSION
    This documentation refers to Net::Abuse::Utils version 0.14.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Abuse::Utils qw( :all );
        print "IP Whois Contacts: ", join( ' ', get_ipwi_contacts($ip) ), "\n";
        print "Abuse.net Contacts: ", get_abusenet_contact($domain), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Abuse::Utils provides serveral functions useful for determining
    information about an IP address including contact/reporting addresses,
    ASN/network info, reverse dns, and DNSBL listing status.

FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are exportable from this module. You may import
    all of them into your namespace with the ":all" tag.

    get_asn_info ( IP )
         Returns a list containing (ASN, Network/Mask, CC code, RIR,
         modified date) for the network announcing "IP".

    get_peer_info ( IP )
         Returns an array of hash references containing (ASN, Network/Mask,
         CC code, RIR, modified date) for the peers of the network
         announcing "IP".

    get_as_description ( ASN )
         Returns the AS description for "ASN".

    get_as_company ( ASN )
         Similiar to "get_as_description" but attempts to clean it up some
         before returning it.

    get_soa_contact( IP )
         Returns the SOA contact email address for the reverse DNS /24 zone
         containing "IP".

    get_ipwi_contacts( IP )
         Returns a list of all email addresses found in whois information
         for "IP" with duplicates removed.

    get_rdns( IP )
         Returns the reverse PTR for "IP".

    get_dnsbl_listing( IP, DNSBL zone )
         Returns the listing text for "IP" for the designated DNSBL. "DNSBL
         zone" should be the zone used for looking up addresses in the
         blocking list.

    get_ip_country( IP )
         Returns the 2 letter country code for "IP".

    get_asn_country( ASN )
         Returns the 2 letter country code for "ASN".

    get_abusenet_contact ( domain )
         Returns the abuse.net listed contact email addresses for "domain".

    is_ip ( IP )
         Returns true if "IP" looks like an IP, false otherwise.

    get_domain ( IP )
         Takes a hostname and attempts to return the domain name.

    get_malware ( md5 )
         Takes a malware md5 hash and tests it against
         http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR. Returns a HASHREF of
         last_seen and detection_rate.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Each subroutine will return undef if unsuccessful. In the furture,
    debugging output will be available.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    There are two commented out lines that can be uncommented to enable
    Memoize support. I haven't yet decided whether to include this option by
    default. It may be made available in the future via an import flag to
    use.

    Net::DNS, Net::Whois::IP, Email::Address
